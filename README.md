  Hey I'm Lea and I'm a junior taking coding I. At first the I just took the class because I wasn't sure what to take but I feel like I've grown to love coding. My partner and I decided to make a website for her dad's medical billing company. We knew it had to be professional, so we went for a simple color scheme and design. My part in the website was as a web developer, though I did help in some of the designing.
